### Machine Learning Projects
This repository showcases ML projects I have developed across different domains.

#### 1. Classification 
A fast‑growing logistics startup was struggling to keep customers satisfied despite repeated efforts to identify improvements. To address this, I set up a machine learning model to predict whether customers were happy or unhappy with delivery services. I tested several approaches, including PCA, Random Forest, and other boosting methods, and found that AdaBoost delivered the best performance with 73% accuracy. While further data will be needed to push accuracy higher, this result provided actionable insights and measurable gains in understanding customer satisfaction, helping the company take initial steps toward improving service quality.

#### 2. CNN 
Traditional methods of detecting Malaria are time-consuming, require specialized expertise, and are labor-intensive. This is not an efficient process, which represents a high burden for the healthcare industry and increases the risk of misdiagnosis, which can be fatal. Deep Learning techniques, particularly CNNs, offer a more effective solution to handle this type of challenges.

#### 4. NLP 
Recruitment teams are receiving an increasing number of job applications, making manual profile analysis more difficult.
AI techniques can facilitate this process by predicting well-matched candidates based on keywords analysis.

#### 5. Prediction
A small startup in the European banking market was seeking to improve customer call success rates by leveraging call center data. The task was to design a machine learning system that could predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit. I explored multiple approaches and developed an evolving product focused on both performance and interpretability, ultimately building an XGBoost model. This model achieved a recall of 88% for detecting positive subscriptions and showed consistent classification across features, providing strong predictive power and actionable insights to help clients make more informed decisions.
