## Machine Learning Projects
This repository showcases various ML projects I have developed across different domains.

#### 1. Classification 
Logistics and delivery companies often struggle to maintain customer satisfaction. To retain existing clients and attract new ones, businesses must address these challenges.
ML & AI algorithms have the capabilities to uncover what is behind of this dissatisfaction and provide actionable insights.

#### 2. CNN 
Traditional methods of detecting Malaria are time-consuming, require specialized expertise, and are labor-intensive. This is not an efficient process, which represents a high burden for the healthcare industry and increases the risk of misdiagnosis, which can be fatal.
Deep Learning techniques, particularly CNNs, offer a more effective solution to handle this type of challenges.
